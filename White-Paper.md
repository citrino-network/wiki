# MintMe.com Coin: 
## A Blockchain for DApps, Secured via Websites
# Abstract:
In Internet of Things era, why limit mining only to PCs with installed specialized software? Every device
with spare resources (including PCs, smartphones and IoT devices), as long as the owner agrees, should
be able to participate in securing the network. MintMe.com Coin is a transparent web-mineable blockchain
platform made to support Decentralized Applications (DApps), where websites can serve as a hardware-
independent alternative to secure ERC20 & ERC223 smart contracts. We are presenting a working, fully
functional, smart contracts enabled blockchain platform. On top of that, we feel committed to building
tools that help in attracting new projects into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. MintMe.com Coin is a platform for
projects that base their business model on mining via websites, for those that want to remain ASIC-
resistant  (and support egalitarian coin distribution), or anyone that wants to spread new revolutionary
ways of website monetization. MintMe.com Coin, and projects built upon it, will be the first real alternatives to
Google Adsense monopoly and will introduce a completely new way for webmasters to generate
revenues.

# Blockchain Backgrounds:

Nine years ago, a technological and economic revolution began, triggered by a simple, yet
transcendent idea: “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need of a trusted third
party.” (Nakamoto, 2009).

Bitcoin introduced a revolutionary way to understand economics: transactions no longer based on third-
party interventions or central overseers. Banks and any other financial institutions replaced by an
ongoing ledger chain created from a hash-based proof-of-work (PoW), registering any transaction on
an encrypted p2p network. Not too long after the success of this idea, Ethereum emerged; a new
blockchain solution, built to extend Bitcoin reaches so that a distributed network of miners could
process complex sets of smart contracts. When Bitcoin’s sha- 256 got dedicated ASIC, mining became
unprofitable for many users due to the rapid increase of block difficulty.

None of the changes conceived as part of Ethereum solved or are going to solve this problem - they are
currently vulnerable to ASIC mining (or even attacks) and later, they plan to move to Proof of Stake,
which won ́t ensure that Ethereum network remains egalitarian. In Proof of Stake, there’s no equal
distribution since owners of many coins get rewarded the most, while those with few coins - the least. It
starts to resemble the old banking model which the current world is built on.

Privacy-oriented blockchains can be an attractive environment for lawbreakers, that’s why holding
transparent and public transactions is convenient for website-minable currencies - even when most
privacy coin users are legit. MintMe Coin team thinks that bitcoin's pseudo-anonymity was the solution
from the beginning. Unnamed wallets help to prevent data theft and snooping, as it occurred in 2018
with Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. At the same time, transactions shouldn’t be obfuscated
because transparency is very important in today’s world.


How would you like it if politicians received Monero-based donations from unknown donors? We
support privacy, but not at the cost of the transaction transparency. Both things are important and both
can be achieved. Not to mention, that there is a real risk in banning privacy coins by regulators —there
are exchanges that already removed Monero and other privacy-based coins because of this^1. All this
could influence privacy coins price in future.

After the first blockchain projects were created, criticism and production of new ones proved that they
were just part of a new technological revolution. A massive social recognition, mass-media coverage
and a rollercoaster of opinions, caused cryptocurrencies and their creators (under real names or
pseudonyms) to become popular, along with the idea of handling transactions through decentralized,
trustless networks. Nowadays, there are many alternative blockchain networks and they are more than
ledgers for financial transactions.

# The current panorama:

The possibility of mining cryptocurrencies via websites emerged along with the creation of
lyra2-webchain, algorithm designed to make CPU and GPU mining similarly efficient while completely
restricting ASICs (CryptoNote Technology, 2018).

To make this possible, MintMe Coin allows the use of javascript-based browser miners which websites can
host to generate hashes on a visitor's machine. Even when there are several blockchains where these
scripts can be used, none of them are platforms that allow users to create their own decentralized
applications (DApps).

The current Dapp market is still young, with a huge potential to grow and disrupt the aging centralized
Internet ecosystem that created giants like Google and Amazon and gave them huge control over the
worldwide web. Through Dapps implementing the ERC20 and ERC223 standards, MintMe Coin is
proposing a simple way to help transition the web from the current monopoly-like ecosystem to a
decentralized future.

Even with the efforts invested to avoid it, lyra2-webchain and other blockchain projects like Ethereum and
Monero got machines with Application-specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips^2 , which concentrate a
greater processing power and profitability level than any unspecialized hardware, therefore allowing a
monopoly in the blockchain production.

Ethereum developers recently faced a dilemma regarding the modification of its protocol in order to
restrict ASICs. Buterin (Ethereum foundation’s main face) is against this change^3 , claiming that
security of transactions is not at risk and that Casper^4 will overcome any current ASICs via PoS;
meanwhile, ETH users will have to accept the presence of ASICs mining in the network, unless they
accept another fork. Although other developers in the Ethereum team seem to consider this possibility
in a more serious way^5 , there’s no consensus or defined institutional statements regarding ASICs as a
danger for Ethereum users nor is there any mention of the effect of PoS on the egalitarian distribution
of new ETH coins.

Facing the enormous difference in block difficulty that
the ASIC machines represent, and the fact that this
increment is designed^6 to happen in order to face the
hashrate growth, a new topic rose among miner users
and coin/token holders about what to do: apply no
changes, hence forcing some users to rely on ASIC
providers, and making others to migrate, or ask
developers to hard fork the algorithms in order to
prevent ASIC miners from operating. Regardless of what option a developer and/or user goes for, this
panorama just shows how legitimate and globally-shared concerns about the presence of ASIC
machines in the blockchain networks are. Being this one of the reasons why we’re proposing a new
protocol.

# Setting the context

Summarizing the above mentioned aspects, the current scenario of cryptocurrencies introduces at least
one decision that protocol creators need to make: either ban or allow ASICs as part of their design.
Choosing to avoid ASIC miners in a protocol is interpreted as part of a design that aims to offer better
opportunities for regular users mining from unspecialized machines, which can be as important to the
system as the blockchain performance.

The enforcement of anonymity is another topic that got blockchain users divided, with some of them
considering the possibility of performing public transactions.

Considering that blockchains are increasing in popularity and acceptance, to choose public transactions
seems to be the most appropriate strategy for social legitimation and institutional legality. If instead,
it’s decided to perform completely anonymous transactions, any possible audit will be forbidden,

(^5) “To compensate the increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of

allowing botnets to hide and perform malicious activities that cannot be tracked by governments. Even
when crypto anarchists believe blockchain networks to be the antithesis of governments, choosing
blockchains over regular institutionalized economies is neither a denial to nation-states legitimacy nor
to the civilian duties of their inhabitants.

On the other hand, blockchain users are concerned about the endurability of their efforts, as a
consequence of the recent actions of companies like Bitmain, with the production of ASIC machines
for Ethereum (which is one of the main platforms currently used for DApps) and the position of some
developers responsible for allowing these kind of miners. Ethereum Classic team, which will also be
affected by ETH ASICs, hasn’t pronounced^7 about these actions, thus reinforcing the worries of the
community.

This is the scenario from which MintMe Coin assembles the requirements to be met. The conditions for its
deliverance are set next.

# MintMe Coin:

It has been created with a clear purpose: to secure DApps using normal and low-end CPUs. In order 
to succeed at that purpose, MintMe Coin applied a custom made version of the lyra2 hashing algorithm.

MintMe Coin conceives the community of website users as the processing grid for applications. The
protocol is constantly being revised in order to avoid exploitation with ASIC, thus keeping well-
balanced block difficulty and device performance. There are over 1.5 billion websites, which are
delivering millions of services every second; through MintMe Coin each of those sites could be securing
DApps.

One of the main limitations for any person willing to mine is to own hardware according to the block
difficulty of the blockchain. This usually translates to high-end machines (with cutting edge CPU &
memory components) and a stable connection while they work. This approach is limitative both on the
usual economic assets of users and the flexibility of connections they have access to.

MintMe Coin doesn’t require a particularly good hardware.
As long as the device has a processor, it will count on a
percentage of unused CPU power and deploy the web
miner, which is executed asynchronously. This allows
users to mine from a good set of devices like a desktop
computer, smartphones, or even those connecting with
IoT.

Besides the possibility of mining coins from almost every internet-connected device, MintMe Coin is
botnet unfriendly, as all transactions made on it are public and trackable, a condition that also
guarantees that no illicit activities could find a hideout here.

MintMe Coin is a public project managed by a group of developers and admins with the support of its
community. The project is available at https://github.com/webchain-network, where people can pull
branches and request for merges into the main repository.

# The protocol:

<b>Name:</b> MintMe.com Coin  
<b>Consensus Mechanism:</b> lyra2-webchain egalitarian PoW  
<b>Base Reward:</b> 50 MINTME  
<b>Era length:</b> 100 000 blocks (~2.5 weeks)  
<b>Block time:</b> 10 seconds  
<b>Smart Contract standard :</b> ERC-20, ERC-223  
<b>Max supply:</b> ~564 000 000 MINTME

In order to keep an egalitarian distribution of work, MintMe Coin will be continuously tweaking the
hashing algorithm; preventing exploitation with ASIC machines, as nobody will design an ASIC
knowing that it will be useless almost instantly after being implemented.


Blocks are grouped into eras. Each era contains 100 000 blocks, so Era 1 contains blocks 0-99999;
Era 2, 100000-199999 and so on. Base reward is reduced every era by 1/250, as described in the
following equation:
<p align="center">
<img width="40%" src="https://github.com/webchain-network/wiki/blob/master/images/Webchain_white_paper-3.png">
</p>

Where x represents the number of eras and y the base reward. Better explained, the base reward in
Era 0 is 50 MINTME, in Era 1 - 49.8 MINTME, Era 2 - 49.6008 MINTME etc. (see the figure below).
